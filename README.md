## Plan on improving the project

- Project: Triple Peaks Coffee Shop
- The function of this project providing customer simple access to menu items that coffeeshop offer and place to book tables.
- We used BEM structure to build this project.
- We have used animation to add some twist to it.
- I think one every we could improve is the Menu. We could improve it by adding card structure to the menu items to show description about the item on one side, on other with picture of the item and price.
